# CovidScreening

## Our Contributions
In summary, our main contributions are:
1) To improve the performance of the previously implemented models, we implemented an Oversampling method in Imbalanced Learning, called SMOTE on my COVID dataset.
2) We also tried to test the performance of MobileNet, GoogLeNet, DenseNet, etc with and without using SMOTE. There was a small improvement in the performance of all the models after performing SMOTE sampling on them.
3) We made our own CNN model.
4) Inorder to deal with the imbalanced dataset on DSCL and CNN models, we also tried to perform experiments using SMOTE-Variants.
